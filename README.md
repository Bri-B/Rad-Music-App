## How it Works

> I want to know what live music is happening near me!

Simply create an account and log in to our app, selecting your favorite genre of music.  The landing page will display nearby shows happening today that match your preferred genre.  

> I wanna find a show at another time or in another place!

Navigate to the 'find a show' page and enter in your desired location and optional filters to see upcoming events matching your specifications.

> I know about a super cool show coming up!

Awesome!  You can add information about future musical spectacles to let all your friends know about it.
